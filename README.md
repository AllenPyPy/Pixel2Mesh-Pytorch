# Pixel2Mesh-Pytorch

This repository aims to implement the ECCV 2018 paper: [Pixel2Mesh: Generating 3D Mesh Models from Single RGB Images](http://bigvid.fudan.edu.cn/pixel2mesh/) in PyTorch. The [official code](https://github.com/nywang16/Pixel2Mesh) in Tensorflow is available online.

More details will be added soon...
